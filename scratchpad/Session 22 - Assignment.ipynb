    "### Assignment: Object-Oriented Programming and Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will design and implement a simple object-oriented system using inheritance, method overriding, method extension, delegation, and the use of slots. Your task is to build a small system involving a few types of people (like `Person`, `Student`, `Professor`, and `Employee`), and apply the inheritance concepts learned from class lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s what you need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Base Class `Person`**:\n",
    "   - The `Person` class should have the following properties:\n",
    "     - `name` (string): The name of the person.\n",
    "     - `age` (integer): The age of the person.\n",
    "     - `job` (string): A description of the person's job.\n",
    "   - The class should include a method `get_details` that returns a string with the person's details, e.g., \"Name: John Doe, Age: 30, Job: Student.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a `Student` Class that Inherits from `Person`**:\n",
    "   - The `Student` class should override the `get_details` method to include their grade in the details. \n",
    "   - The `Student` class should also have an additional attribute `grade`, which is a string (e.g., \"A\", \"B\", etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a `Professor` Class that Inherits from `Person`**:\n",
    "   - The `Professor` class should override the `get_details` method to include the courses they teach.\n",
    "   - The `Professor` class should also have an additional attribute `courses`, which is a list of strings representing the courses they teach.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create an `Employee` Class that Inherits from `Person`**:\n",
    "   - The `Employee` class should override the `get_details` method to include the department they work in.\n",
    "   - The `Employee` class should also have an additional attribute `department`, which is a string representing the department (e.g., \"HR\", \"IT\").\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create a `StudentProfessor` Class that Inherits from Both `Student` and `Professor`**:\n",
    "   - Use the concept of multiple inheritance to create a class that represents a person who is both a student and a professor. \n",
    "   - Ensure that the `get_details` method calls both parent classes to display the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Add a `Location` Class Using Slots**:\n",
    "   - Create a `Location` class that uses `__slots__` to restrict the attributes to `name`, `longitude`, and `latitude`.\n",
    "   - The `Location` class should have a `get_coordinates` method that returns the longitude and latitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Must**: Use `super()` to delegate method calls where necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Your Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to write tests using `pytest` to verify that your classes behave as expected. Below is a sample test suite to help guide your implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pytest\n",
    "from your_module import Person, Student, Professor, Employee, StudentProfessor, Location\n",

    "    person = Person(\"Alice\", 30, \"Engineer\")\n",
    "    assert person.get_details() == \"Name: Alice, Age: 30, Job: Engineer\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_student_details():\n",
    "    student = Student(\"Bob\", 20, \"Student\", \"A\")\n",
    "    assert student.get_details() == \"Name: Bob, Age: 20, Job: Student, Grade: A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_professor_details():\n",
    "    professor = Professor(\"Dr. Smith\", 45, \"Professor\", [\"Math\", \"Physics\"])\n",
    "    assert professor.get_details() == \"Name: Dr. Smith, Age: 45, Job: Professor, Courses: ['Math', 'Physics']\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_employee_details():\n",
    "    employee = Employee(\"John\", 40, \"Employee\", \"HR\")\n",
    "    assert employee.get_details() == \"Name: John, Age: 40, Job: Employee, Department: HR\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_student_professor_details():\n",
    "    student_professor = StudentProfessor(\"Dr. Brown\", 50, \"Professor\", [\"Computer Science\"], \"B\")\n",
    "    assert student_professor.get_details() == \"Name: Dr. Brown, Age: 50, Job: Professor, Courses: ['Computer Science'], Grade: B\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_location_creation():\n",
    "    location = Location(\"Paris\", 48.8566, 2.3522)\n",
    "    assert location.get_coordinates() == (48.8566, 2.3522)\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_person_inheritance():\n",
    "    student = Student(\"Charlie\", 22, \"Student\", \"B\")\n",

    "    location = Location(\"Tokyo\", 35.6762, 139.6503)\n",
    "    location.name = \"Kyoto\"\n",
    "    assert location.name == \"Kyoto\"\n",
    "    with pytest.raises(AttributeError):\n",
    "        location.country = \"Japan\"  # Slots prevent this attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_multiple_inheritance():\n",
    "    student_professor = StudentProfessor(\"Dr. White\", 60, \"Professor\", [\"Engineering\"], \"A\")\n",
    "    assert isinstance(student_professor, Student)\n",
    "    assert isinstance(student_professor, Professor)\n",
    "    assert student_professor.get_details() == \"Name: Dr. White, Age: 60, Job: Professor, Courses: ['Engineering'], Grade: A\"\n",

    "### GitHub Actions Configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "To automate testing of the assignment using GitHub Actions, create a file `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` with the following content:\n",
